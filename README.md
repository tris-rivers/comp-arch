# DLSU CSC612M Integrating project
This repository contains the code in fulfillment of CSC612M (Computer Organization and Architecture) Integrating Project.
The project is all about GPU architecture, and implemented sample programs on **CUDA** and **JAX** to showcase GPU.
The repository is split into two folders:

- **`intro-cuda`**: contains sample codes on introduction to CUDA, implemented a function that linearly adds two matrices with 1M elements each. Implemented on C++ and different CUDA configurations.
- **`neural network`**: contains the C++ and CUDA implementation of a Multilayer Perceptron.
